Welcome to the second week of GSoC. This was the last week of our community bonding period. Nine people have been selected in Sugar Labs this year, it was nice getting to know where they are from and on what tech stack/ project they will be working. Similar to last week I was assigned a few tasks this week as well which included:  
### 1. Rethinking Sugar-Web Integration in Exerciser.  
After struggling for the entire two weeks I was finally able to find a solution to this with the help of my mentor. This issue was basically about finding a way to configure requireJS to change the base URL while importing modules. There are a few points related to this.  
1. It is somewhat a bit difficult to get requireJS to work in web pack environment.  
2. web pack needs to be configured with [shabang-loader](https://github.com/JavascriptIsMagic/shebang-loader) in order to import requireJS.  
3. Webpack can be easily configured for any JS based applications but not for applications build with create-react-app boilerplate. Create react app was designed in such a way so that the developer had only to focus on creating the app and not on web pack configuration. Therefore there is no web-pack.config file that is generally needed to configure webpack. As a solution for it, I found an article [here](https://medium.com/@ryoldash/customize-webpack-config-of-react-app-created-with-create-react-app-7a78c7849edc) which I think you may also find to be useful.  
4. Importing requireJS returns an object and not a function which it is supposed to.

Let me know if you guys find a way to import requireJS as a function in webpack env.
A workaround for the above problem of baseURL is to configure Webpack for resolve.alias. A similar approach can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27502608/resolving-require-paths-with-webpack).

### 2. Solving the issue of blanks reusability in cloze forms [#63](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/issues/63).  
You have can a look at the solution code [here](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/pull/65).

### 3. Adding thumbnail images to default activities.
Last week I worked to integrate thumbnail of exercises in Exceriser. The thumbnail will be decided by the author during the time of creating the exercises. This issue relates to the existing default exercises with no thumbnail. I found some pictures from creative commons for the default exercises as you can see below.

### 4. Improving custom build Image Editor.
As a continuation of last week work, I was asked to improve the Image editors' UI and make it work for mobile devices as well. After a week's work, this is what I have been able to create.

It was great sharing this milestone with you. Next week is going to be challenging a lot as I will be starting off with my proposal's idea, looking forward to seeing you all next week. 
Have a great week ahead.
