Welcome to the fourth week of the Coding Period. This week I mainly worked on Multimedia integration in Cloze and Reoder Template.
### 1. Multimedia Integration in Cloze Template.
Earlier user could only use `text` as Question, but with [this](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/pull/70) patch of code, user's will also be able to post Images/Audios/Text-To-Speech media elements as Questions. The UI of this implementation is shown below.

### 2. Multimedia Integration in Reodering Template.
Similar to Cloze, earlier reodering template also only allowed the use of text as question, but [this](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/pull/71) patch of code allows the use of other media types as well.

The earlier implementation of list's drag-drop got a bit confusing with multimedia implementaion, as clicking on a media element would both play and drag it, so in order to avoid this I have added a `handler` near the left corner so user can now drag the list only by using the handler.

### 4. Testing changes with APK builder.
Apart from using Sugarizer on Web, Sugarizer can also be used on mobile devices. You can find the Playstore link [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.olpc_france.sugarizer&hl=en_IN). 
There is an application developed by my mentor Lionel Lask√© which enables the conversion of JS based Sugarizer file to java based files - [Sugarizer-AP-Builder](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-apkbuilder). I used it to test the new implementation of multimedia in Exerciser and was glad to know that everything works just fine.

It was great sharing this milestone with you. Looking forward to seeing you all next week. 
Have a great week ahead.
