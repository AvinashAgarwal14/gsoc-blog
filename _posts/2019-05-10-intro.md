Hello Everyone! This is my very first post among the series of posts that will be coming up during this GSoC time period. Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school. I have been trying to be a part of GSoC from the last year but unfortinaley was not shortlisted the las time. Nevertheless I am so glad to tell you all that it makes me very happy to be a part of this year's GSoC.  
I will be working to contribute to Sugar Lab's Exerciser project. It is a react based app through which user can create questions in various formats(MCQ, Fill in the Blanks etc) and other users can answer them. A comparative study of responses of a group of people can also be made. You can have a lot at the application here - [Sugarizer](https://try.sugarizer.org/).  
```
My work will primarily be:
1. To add new Templates.
2. To integrate a remote library of Exercises.
3. Introduce Exerciser's own Image Editor.
```  
The details of which can be found here -  [Project-Idea](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5993905961566208). I will keep posting about my progress during the entire GSoC timeline. See you all in Week 1.
