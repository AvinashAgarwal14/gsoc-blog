Welcome to the very first week of me being a GSoC student. Right now we are the middle of the Community Bonding period, where selected students get to know about their mentor organisations, their community, discuss suitable changes to the Proposal and starts to get familiar with the huge code base they will be working on in the coming twelve weeks.

Likewise, I was assigned a few tasks this week in order to get familiar with the code base before I dive right into it. In this post, I will be sharing my experience about the challenges I faced and the tasks I accomplished. Let me reiterate that all my tasks are related to the project [Exerciser](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact) I earlier talked about.
Starting with, this week I was assigned six major tasks some of them being easy and some being difficult.  

The easier ones being:   
1. Solving issue [#7](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/issues/7).
2. Solving issue [#37](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/issues/37). 
3. Solving issue [#40](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/issues/40).

The harder ones being:

{:start="4"}
4. Including thumbnails for all the Exercises added in the activity.
5. Building a ReactJS based Image Editor using cropperJS.
6. Re-Integration of Sugar-Web files in Exerciser [#58](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/issues/58).

I was successfully able to solve the first three easier tasks assigned to me, which in turn boosted my confidence. Among the harder ones I able to solve the fourth and the fifth one. You can find the image of the thumbnail feature added below. Though there are other UI changes that need to be done with respect to this feature and will be taken up later on.

With respect to the fifth issue, you can find the Web-React based Image-Editor I have build using cropperJS  [here](https://github.com/AvinashAgarwal14/Image-Editor). There are some minor bugs that needs to be fixed on which I will be working on in the coming week. Regarding the sixth issue, it was difficult for me to find a way around it so I will be trying to solve it in the coming week.

Apart from the above stated issues that require some more work, I have been assinged other new tasks by my mentor for this coming week. Looking forward to solving them and letting you all know about it in the next week.
