Welcome to the seventh week of the Coding Period. I am very glad to share that I have successfully completed phase-1 of the GSoC coding period. For the last two weeks, I have been mainly working on the addition of two new templates and their related user interface. Apart from the new UI, the templates also perform previously included functionality such as providing detailed results, neighbourhood view etc. The inspiration for both these templates is taken from learning apps.
### 1. Addition of Group Assignment Template.
This template allows users to create questions and answers in such a format that the question needs to be dragged to their corresponding answer's group. To implement this drag and drop functionality I used [interactJS](https://interactjs.io/). The different groups in the template are rendered using different colours to make the UI more child-friendly.

    <img src="/gsoc-blog/asset/img/week8/group-player.png" style="width: 50%; float: right;"/>
</p>  

### 2. Addition of Freetext Input Template.
This template allows users to create questions, that appear as tiles/cards to the fronted users and lets him/her provide textual answers for them. 

<p style="text-align: center;">Freetext Form and Player</p>

    <img src="/gsoc-blog/asset/img/week8/freetext-form.png" style="display: inline; width: 50%;"/>

It was great sharing this milestone with you. Looking forward to seeing you all next week. 
Have a great week ahead.
