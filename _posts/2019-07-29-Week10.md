Welcome to the ninth week of the Coding Period. I am very glad to inform you all that I have successfully passed Phase - 2 of the coding period. For the last two weeks I have been working on number of issues as have been mentioned below, the prominent one being addiiton of tutorials in the application.
### 1. Sugar-Web library Update.
This new update of sugar-web files is a major milestone. Earlier the size of Journal was limited to only few MBs(approx 10). So it was nearly impossible to leverage the feature of (Multimedia integration)[] in Exerciser. But with this update the size of the Journal is increased approximately in the range of the available disk space (100s of MBs), which solves the problems of storing space consuming media elements.

### 2. Creating a new component for Multimedia JSX.
Earlier the code snippet to include Multimedia in Exercises was not generalized and hence lead to alot of redundant code, this file [here](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/pull/79/files#diff-521884fc722878bf942eeff161c40409R1) generalises Multimedia Integration for all templates and hence removes the redundancy.

### 3. Remove Default Exercises from Shared Activity.
Earlier in addition to the shared exercises default exercises were also showed to the user connected to a network(for a short duration). This [PR](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact/pull/82) takes care of this issue.

### 4. Option to delete question in a template.
Earlier user could not delete a particular question while creating or editng an exercises. But now with the help of the button shown below, users can also delete a particular question from an exercise.

</p>

### 5. Addition of Tutorials
Similiar to the presence of a help button in Sugarizer, a help button has also been added to Exercises. Clicking on this help button shows a tutorials as to the functionality and the usecase of all the options present in the screen. Its UI is simiiar to the UI present in Sugarizer as shown below.

It was great sharing this milestone with you. Looking forward to seeing you all next week. 
Have a great week ahead.
