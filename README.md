# GSoC-Blog
The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which students complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. This website contains blogs related to my milestones in GSoC '19 where I contributed to the project [Exerciser](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact) under the organisation [Sugar Labs](https://sugarlabs.org/).
